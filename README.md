<b>Problem 1 : Minimum Operations to Make the Smallest to the Largest </b> <br>
You are given an array A of size N.<br>

Let M be the minimum value present in the array initially. In one operation, you can choose an element Ai (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and an integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ 100), and set Ai = X. <br>

Determine the minimum number of operations required to make M the maximum value in the array A <br>
<b>Input Format </b> <br>

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of multiple lines of input: The first line of each test case contains a single integer N — the size of the array. The next line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN — the elements of the array. <br>
