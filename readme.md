In a realm of numbers, you are given a mystical square matrix of size . Your task is to uncover the hidden sums of each row and column within this matrix. For each index ( i ) in the resultant array ( A ), you need to compute the value as follows:

Row Sum: Calculate the sum of all elements in the ( i )th row of the matrix.
Column Sum: Calculate the sum of all elements in the ( i )th column of the matrix.
You will then create the resultant array ( A ) where each element is defined by:

Input Format

The input begins with an integer ( N ), indicating the dimensions of the square matrix, followed by ( N ) lines, each containing ( N ) integers representing the elements of the matrix.

Constraints

Output Format

Your final output will be the elements of the resultant array ( A ), printed in a single line, separated by spaces.
